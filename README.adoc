= Gits

> Makes messing up across multiple git repositories easier.

== Problem statement

You have multiple git repositories and you want to make changes to them at the same time.

== Example

Typically you have all your repos checked out in the same directory.

You start by making the code changes in the repos that need to be modified.

Now you give all the dirty repos a common branch name, e.g. `bugfix-123`

[source, bash]
----
$ gits -dirty git checkout -b bugfix-123
----

Next you want to commit all the changes on the repos that are on that branch :

[source, bash]
----
$ gits -branch bugfix-123 git commit -a -m "fix: bug 123"
----

Then you want to push all those branches...

[source, bash]
----
$ gits -branch bugfix-123 git push -u origin bugfix-123
----

And then create pull requests, assigning a specific (unlucky) reviewer, e.g. `victim123`

[source, bash]
----
$ gits -branch bugfix-123 gh pr create --fill-first -r victim123
----

== Installation

[source,bash]
----
$ go install github.com/stephenc/gits@latest
----

To see the available options use `gits -help`

[source,bash]
----
$ gits -help
Usage: gits [options] command [args...]
  -branch string
    	only match repositories on this branch
  -clean
    	only match repositories with a clean worktree
  -dirty
    	only match repositories with a dirty worktree
  -help
    	display help message
  -parallel int
    	number of parallel tasks (default 12)
